# Hydrogeological Report Repository

This GitHub repository contains a hydrogeological report along with the necessary code for data analysis and visualization. The report describes the methodology used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity ($K$) in a given medium using Darcy's law.

## Introduction
The hydrogeological report in this repository provides an overview of an experiment conducted to measure the hydraulic conductivity in a specific medium. The report discusses the theory, experimental setup, and data analysis techniques used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity.

## Contents
The repository includes the following files:

- `report.tex`: This LaTeX file contains the complete hydrogeological report, including the report text, figures, and tables.
- `code.py`: This Python code file contains the code used for data preparation, calculation of hydraulic resistance, and generation of data visualizations.
- `images/`: This directory contains the images used in the report.
- `README.md`: This file provides information about the repository and the content it contains.

## Usage
To access and use the hydrogeological report and the associated code:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/hydrogeological-report
```

2. Open the `report.tex`
